# TOP Javascript Course Project - To Do List
02/25/2022 ~ 03/15/2022

## Objectives
Using webpack, create a to do list app. You can use external libraries.

To do list items should have at least the following properties:
- Title
- Description
- Due Date
- Priority

Your to do list items should go under a Project.
- Users should be able to create new projects
- Users should be able to choose which project their to-dos go into

Your user interface should at least have the following:
- View all projects
- View all to-dos in each project
- Expand a single to-do to see/edit its details
- Delete a to-do

Using Web Storage API allow the user to store their to-do data locally.

## Learnings
I ended up cutting out quite a few features but would like to revist this project later. Getting local storage set with store.js was incredibly quick and easy.
